# Malware-Packer
 
My own implementation for a malware packer.


Before packing, we must use the AddProcess program to pack the malicious executable into the stub's resource section.


The final packed version will contain the stub that automatically unpack the resource section and use Process Hollowing to create a new process of *Calculator.exe*, overwrite its virtual memory with the malicious executable code, and execute it.
